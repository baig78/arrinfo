                    <p class="lead">We got our start doing things differently. Instead of a grueling, up-or-out career, we offered balance and sanity. The opportunity to love both your work and your life. To prioritize family and work on high-impact projects with companies
                        in your community.
                        <br> <br> Invest in people. Invest in communities. Invest in our clients’ success. That was the idea. Today, ANR Infotech Group is a $2.9B company with over 13,000 employees and is routinely named a best place to work. Our clients include
                        more than half the Fortune 100 and a third of the Fortune 500—along with startups, not-for-profits, and innovative organizations of all kinds.</p>
